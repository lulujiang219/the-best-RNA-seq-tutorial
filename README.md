# I swear this is the most simple, comprehensive, beginner-friendly guide to RNA sequencing
## A little about me ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I'm Lulu, a first-year Bioinformatics PhD student at the University of Iowa. My journey with RNA-seq has been quite the adventure - I started in wet-lab biology (BA) and then moved to bioinformatics (MS).

## Why I created this guide ðŸ¤”
During my PhD, I realized something: RNA-seq is EVERYWHERE. Every lab uses it, every researcher needs it. But here's the thing - when I first learned RNA-seq in my master's program, I could run the analysis, but I felt like I was missing the bigger picture:

- Where does the data actually come from?
- What happens in the wet lab before the data reaches our computers?
- Why do we even do RNA-seq in the first place?

I spent countless hours with hundreds of browser tabs open, jumping between different resources. That's when I thought: "There has to be a better way!"

## What makes this guide different âœ¨
As someone who loves **SIMPLE** explanations (and hates overcomplicated ones!), I wrote this guide with a clear goal: **to explain RNA-seq so simply that even a 10-year-old could understand it!**

English isn't my first language, and I know the frustration of reading something where you understand all the words but still think "Wait... what did I just read?" That's why this guide:

- Uses simple, clear language
- Includes lots of visual explanations
- Breaks down complex concepts into digestible pieces
- Connects wet-lab and computational aspects
- Explains the "why" behind every step

This is the guide I wish I had when I started - perfect for future me (when I inevitably forget the details) and for anyone else who wants to truly understand RNA-seq from start to finish.
